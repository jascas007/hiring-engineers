Collecting Metrics:

    Add tags in the Agent config file and show us a screenshot of your host and its tags on the Host Map page in Datadog.

In the datadog.yaml file, I added these tags:

tags:
    - great-tag:so-great
    - much-tag:very-much
    - very-tag:such-tag

I restarted my agent, navigated to my Host Map page, and I got these results when I filtered by my tags:
